# Number Guesser Doubles

### Project Description

Our team of two worked together to create the Number Guesser game. We wanted to create a functional game, where users could pick their number range and see who is able to pick the number first. This game gave us a chance to further develop our skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In addition, this was our first time creating branches in GitHub and working together as a team.
